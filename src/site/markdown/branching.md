## Branching Model

Branching model here is **simplified** and doesn't follow [*Gitflow*](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/):

* 1 `main` branch.
* `feature/short-description` branches for new features and bug fixes, or `trivial/short-description` for trivial changes, like indentation, white spaces, etc.
* `release/vX.Y.Z` branches for releases (this is done automatically by the [release workflow](https://github.com/sentrysoftware/workflows/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#maven-central-release)).
* No `hotfix` or `bugfix` branches.
* `vX.Y.Z` tags for each release.
* Pull Requests (PR):
  * The PR requests to merge your branch in your repository (cloned or forked) into the `main` branch of the "official" repository (origin).
  * 1 code review is required to merge the PR.
  * PRs are "merged", **not** squashed, and **not** rebased.
  * No sign-off is required (for now).
