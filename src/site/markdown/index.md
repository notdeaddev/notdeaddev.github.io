# The Home of Not-Dead Projects

*Where open-source legends stay alive.*

Many once-great open-source projects shaped the way we build software; but they were abandoned when their creators moved on, lacked time, or couldn‚Äôt sustain the effort.

## üßü Projects we host

We curate influential but abandoned frameworks, tools, and libraries across ecosystems. Some first residents:

## ü™¶ Mission

**notdead.dev** exists to:

* **Preserve**: Keep historic open-source projects accessible in a curated home.
* **Maintain**: Use AI (Codex, Copilot, etc.) to handle basic upkeep: dependency updates, build fixes, linting, and minimal modernization.
* **Support**: Provide compatibility patches for teams still relying on these frameworks.
* **Educate**: Let developers explore and learn from the software that built the web we know today.

## ‚õèÔ∏è How it works

Each project lives in its own repository under this organization.

An AI maintenance bot runs scheduled tasks to:

* Update dependencies
* Fix builds/tests
* Apply lint and minor modernization

Pull Requests are created automatically, with humans only stepping in for reviews and big-picture decisions.

The goal is compatibility, not innovation: projects remain faithful to their original spirit.

## ‚ö∞Ô∏è Projects Under consideration

* Backbone.js
* Knockout.js
* Ember.js (mostly frozen)
* Grunt
* Bower
* Gulp
* Yeoman
* Protractor
* Karma
* Jasmine (light maintenance)
* Docpad
* Wintersmith
* Hexo
* Meteor
* Rhino / Nashorn (JS on the JVM)
* Apache Struts 1.x
* YUI
* Blueprint CSS

## üôè Contributing

We welcome help!

* Suggest projects for adoption by opening an issue.
* Improve docs, fix AI mistakes, or provide historical context.

If you used one of these frameworks in production, share your story in the repo‚Äôs Discussions tab ‚Äî part of our mission is honoring their history.

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Projects here are maintained for educational and compatibility purposes only. They are not intended as modern production-ready solutions. Use with care and love ‚ù§Ô∏è.
