# Contributing

You have found a bug or you have an idea for a cool new feature? Contributing code is a great way to give something back to
the open source community. Before you dig right into the code there are a few guidelines that we need contributors to
follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=1|toDepth=2|id=toc} -->

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
* Find the corresponding [repository on GitHub](repos.html).
* Submit a **GitHub issue** in the repository to request a change, **assuming one does not already exist**.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Include screenshots and outputs whenever relevant.
  * If known, explain what should be changed to fix the problem.
  * If possible, specify how to test the new feature.
* [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and check out your forked repository.

## Making changes

* Ensure your fork of the repository is up-to-date (use [GitHub's fork sync feature](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork), and pull to your local clone of the repository).
* Create a _topic branch_ for your isolated work, named `feature/short-description` (the name is prefixed with `feature/` even if your change fixes a bug).
  * Usually you should base your branch on the `main` branch.
  * A good topic branch name can be the GitHub issue id (#_nnn_) plus a short description, e.g. `feature/issue-53-fix-https-certificate`.
  * If you have submitted multiple issues, try to maintain separate branches and pull requests.
  * Check our [branching model](branching.html) for more details.
* Make commits of logical units.
  * Make sure your commit messages are meaningful and in the proper format. Your commit message should contain the key of the GitHub issue.
  * Example: `Issue #53: Changed the implementation of the keystore`
* Respect the original code style (tabs, spaces, line width, etc.):
  * Create minimal diffs -- disable _On Save_ actions like _Reformat Source Code_ or _Organize Imports_. If you feel the source code should be reformatted or refactored somehow, create a separate PR for this change first. **Smaller changes are more likely to get approved by reviewers!**
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run all the tests **before** submitting a PR to ensure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* Build the project site (if any) and verify the configured code quality reports (in the **Project Reports** section).

### Making trivial changes

Cosmetic or trivial changes in a project, like indentation, white spaces, typos, or minor refactoring **don't require** creating a dedicated GitHub issue, but they must not be mixed with other significant changes: a separate commit and separate Pull Request must be submitted.

In this case, the _topic branch_ should be named `trivial/short-description`.

## Submitting changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a _Pull Request_ (PR) to the corresponding repository in the `notdeaddev` organization.
  * Verify _Files Changed_ shows only your intended changes and does not include additional files or changes like white spaces, etc.
  * Make sure all automatic checks are successful.
  * Verify comments produced automatically by code quality automatic checks.
* When implementing additional changes after reviewers suggestions, simply commit and push such changes. **Never squash or rebase commits that you have already pushed!**
* Once your PR is merged (if approved), [sync your forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork), pull these changes to your locally cloned repository and delete your branch.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
